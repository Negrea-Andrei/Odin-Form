## Structure

The project structure is quite straightforward:

- **index.html**: Contains the main HTML structure of the form.
- **stylesheet.css**: Stylesheet file for applying visual styles.
- **code.js**: JavaScript file for adding dynamic behavior to the form.

## Styles

Visual styling is achieved through the `stylesheet.css` file. Feel free to modify this file to customize the appearance of the Odin Form according to your preferences.

## Script

Dynamic functionality and interactions are handled by the `code.js` file. Adjustments or enhancements to form behavior can be made within this JavaScript file.
